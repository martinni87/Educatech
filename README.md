# Educatech

## Description
Educatech is a project developed as part of my final coursework in 
Cross-platform Applications Development.

### Functionalities as of the last update:
* Authentication methods, including sign-up, login, and logout, are 
implemented with listed providers: Email, Facebook and Google.

* Authentication methods, linked. Now the same user can access the app
with any of the providers listed above, and then link other providers to
its account.

* Firebase storage and Firebase Firestore Database. Now a user access to
the app with any provider, and can see a feed of new courses, click on each
and see its details.

***More updates coming soon.***
